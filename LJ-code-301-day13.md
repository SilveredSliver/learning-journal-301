#LJ Code 301 - Day 13

It's already Wednesday of week 3 and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't getting nervous, not just because I need to boost my grade, but also because the final exam for gaining entry to 401 is coming up and then project week. Whatever team I end up with, I hope it's people I can communicate fairly easily with at a minimum; makes me wish I had written more after each paired programming assignment we turned in over the last several days. It's time to get started and get moving then.
