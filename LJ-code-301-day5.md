#LJ Code 301 - Day 5

JQuery is fun and oh so useful! It takes some adjustment remembering to use $('something') as opposed to .getElementById('') but I think I am getting the hang of it. Honestly, I can't remember the last thing I was doing today, but I feel moderately comfortable with the current situation (that will probably change by tomorrow). Here's hoping that I'll be able to keep up, but still difficult to stay awake during lecture, especially after having just eaten lunch. I do better in the mornings.
