#LJ Code 301 - Day 6

Yep! That feeling of understanding went away, lovely. It was nice while it lasted though.
Welp, going to attempt to make the best of a worsening situation haha. Paired programming helps a lot though in terms of filling in the gaps. I make it out to seem worse than it actually is. Not much else to write atm...it's Monday.
