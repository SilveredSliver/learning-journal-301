#LJ Code 301 - Day 10

I'm actually writing this on Monday (day 11) and I confess, procrastination is much easier than keeping up-to-date with the homework. I admit, I feel rather daunted by the code wars simply by reviewing what others have answered to the same problems, but in the end I'm not concerned with that as long as I get the answer. I am not sure how I'm fairing currently in terms of understanding all  the back end lectures and exercises that we've been having. Maybe I'll get a better understanding of it with more reading.
